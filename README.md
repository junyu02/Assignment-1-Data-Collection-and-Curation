Data Formï¼šhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tm0ubRN7sQ1MwMuzfZiMSCDBwEFCKQN4f8jXEjdoMAM/edit?usp=sharing
The data is collected from Junyu Wei, and the source data is approved by the person filling out the form.
This Form has 4 questions: Do you drink coffee daily? (Yes/No) How many coffee you drink daily (Starbucks Grande cup)? (Single choice) Why do you drink coffee? (multiple choice) Do you think coffee works for you? (single choice)
According to the questionnaire, the last question should not appear on the form because the number of people who drink coffee daily is split 40/60 between those who drink coffee daily and those who do not. The last question would be biased because of this. This data did not appear in the production of the graphical analysis questionnaire.
